Autism Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder affecting communication, behavior, and social interaction.  
Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and support.  

This project uses **Machine Learning models** (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests) to predict whether an individual may show signs of autism, based on questionnaire responses and demographic features.
